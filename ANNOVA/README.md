# ANNOVA Analysis of Variance

When it comes to the comparison of means of different groups in the data, we generally do the comparison pairwise. For instance, if there are four groups, we compare the mean of one group with the mean of other groups one after the other. This might feel easy, as we are dealing with four groups in the dataset, but when we deal with huge data sets with more groups this procedure will be tricky and difficult. This is where ANOVA comes to play, which is a holistic approach to examine whether there is proof that at least one set of groups are different.

This program is to demonstrate the concept of ANNOVA to find out the differing group mean
