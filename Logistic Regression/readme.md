# Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a change of the linear regression model that permits us to probabilistically display binary variables. It is otherwise called a summed-up direct model that utilizes a logit interface. Logistic regression is a go-to demonstration for this utilization case. It displays the likelihood that perception takes on one of those two qualities. Instead of classing forecasts alone, as in SVMs. This allows us to measure the certainty of our model in its forecasts, and to play with class choice limits. Logistic regression is an ideal candidate model when we should have the option to clarify the effect of every predictor. A predictor's coefficients measure the effect of each feature on our model's forecasts through the proportion of the chances.
